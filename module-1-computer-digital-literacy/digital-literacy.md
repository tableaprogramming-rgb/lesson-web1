## 📂 1. The Digital Library: Files and Folders
Think of your computer as a massive, high-speed digital library.

### 📄 Files (The Books)
*   **What they are**: Individual units of data stored on your disk.
*   **Properties**: Every file has a **Name**, a **Size**, and a **Path**.
*   **Web Logic**: In web development, a "site" isn't a single thing—it's a collection of many individual files working together.

### 📁 Folders (The Shelves)
*   **Purpose**: To group related files together.
*   **Nesting**: Folders can contain other folders (sub-directories).
*   **Root Directory**: The main folder that contains everything for a specific project.

## 🏷️ 2. File Extensions: The Secret Language
The three or four letters at the end of a filename tell the computer (and you) what's inside.

### 🌐 Web Essentials
*   **.html**: The structure (The skeleton).
*   **.css**: The style (The skin).
*   **.js**: The behavior (The brain).

### 🖼️ Assets
*   **.png / .jpg**: Static images.
*   **.svg**: Scalable vector graphics (perfect for icons).
*   **.webp**: Modern, high-compression images for the web.

> **Pro Tip**: Always enable "Show File Name Extensions" in your operating system settings. A developer must always see the full filename. [1]

## ⌨️ 3. Keyboard Shortcuts: The Developer's Speed
Using a mouse is slow. Developers use "shortcuts" to stay in the "flow."

### 🚀 Universal Essentials
*   **Ctrl/Cmd + S**: Save (Do this every 30 seconds!).
*   **Ctrl/Cmd + C / V**: Copy and Paste.
*   **Ctrl/Cmd + Z**: Undo (The "Time Machine").
*   **Ctrl/Cmd + Tab**: Switch between open applications.

### 💻 VS Code Power Moves
*   **Ctrl/Cmd + B**: Toggle the sidebar.
*   **Ctrl/Cmd + P**: Quick-open any file by name.
*   **Ctrl/Cmd + /**: Comment out a line of code.
*   **Alt + Up/Down**: Move a line of code up or down.

## 📏 4. Professional Naming Conventions
Computers are picky. How you name your files matters.

*   **No Spaces**: `my-new-page.html` is better than `my new page.html`.
*   **Lowercase Only**: Always use lowercase for web files to avoid server issues.
*   **Kebab-Case**: Separate words with dashes (`about-us.html`).
*   **Descriptive Tags**: Use clear names like `logo.png` instead of `image123.png`.

## 🛠️ 5. Setting Up Your Workspace
Before writing code, your "desk" must be clean.

1.  **Project Folder**: Create one folder for the whole course (e.g., `web-dev-101`).
2.  **Module Folders**: Create sub-folders for each module.
3.  **Asset Folders**: Keep images and styles in their own `/assets` sub-folder.

## 🚀 Summary
Mastering your computer is the first step to mastering the web. Digital literacy isn't just about knowing where buttons are; it's about understanding how data is structured and how to manipulate it with speed and precision.

**Next Module**: We will explore **Web Architecture** and the Client-Server model.
