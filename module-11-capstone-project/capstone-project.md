# Module 11: Capstone Project

Congratulations on making it this far! You've completed a comprehensive journey through web development fundamentals—from HTML structure to CSS styling to JavaScript interactivity. Now it's time to prove mastery by building something real: your **Capstone Project**.

The capstone project is your opportunity to synthesize everything you've learned into a complete, professional website. This module provides the roadmap, requirements, and support you need to succeed.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

The capstone project aims to:

* **Integrate All Learning**: Apply HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design in one cohesive project
* **Demonstrate Proficiency**: Show you can plan, build, test, and deploy a website
* **Build Portfolio Work**: Create a piece you're proud to show employers or clients
* **Solve Real Problems**: Build something useful or interesting, not just theoretical exercises
* **Practice Professional Workflows**: Use version control, testing, and deployment practices

---

## 📋 Project Requirements

Your capstone project must meet these specifications:

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

* **Minimum 3 pages**: Home, at least one content page, and a third page (about, portfolio, contact, etc.)
* **Responsive design**: Works beautifully on mobile (< 768px), tablet (768px-1024px), and desktop (> 1024px)
* **Semantic HTML**: Use proper semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
* **Custom CSS**: All styling created by you (Bootstrap is optional but not a substitute for custom CSS)
* **Navigation**: Consistent navigation between pages (navbar, menu, or links)
* **Interactive Features**: At least two of the following:
  - Form with validation (contact form, sign-up, etc.)
  - Smooth scroll or scroll-triggered animations
  - DOM manipulation (show/hide content, dynamic lists, etc.)
  - Modal dialogs or popups
  - Image gallery or carousel
* **Professional Polish**: Clean code, no console errors, good performance

### Additional Excellence Criteria (Stretch Goals)

* **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (proper contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
* **Performance**: Pages load in < 3 seconds
* **Cross-browser testing**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
* **SEO basics**: Meta tags, descriptive titles, semantic HTML
* **Advanced interactivity**: Complex JavaScript logic, AJAX requests, real-time validation
